    <string name="about_aish">Aishwarya Rai is an Indian film actress.
                      She worked as a model before starting her
                      acting career, and ultimately won the
                      Miss World pageant in 1994.
                      Rai has featured in films in various
                      languages including Hindi, English, Tamil,
                      Telugu, and Bengali. Often cited by the
                      media as the \&apos;most beautiful woman
                      in the world\&apos;, Rai made her acting
                      debut with Mani Ratnam\&apos;s Tamil film
                      Iruvar (1997), and had her first commercial
                      success in Jeans (1998). She found success 
                      in Bollywood with Sanjay Leela Bhansali\&apos;s 
                      Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) and 
                      Devdas (2002) and eventually won two
                      Filmfare Awards in the Best Actress category. 
                      After a series of unsuccessful films during
                      2003â€“2005, she appeared in the blockbuster
                      action thriller Dhoom 2 (2006) and
                      subsequently featured in such films as
                      Guru (2007), Jodhaa Akbar (2008),
                      and Enthiran (2010). She gained critical
                      acclaim for her performances in offbeat,
                      independent films such as Chokher Bali (2003),
                      Raincoat (2004), and Provoked (2007).
                      Rai has thus established herself as one of the
                      leading contemporary actresses of Indian cinema</string>
